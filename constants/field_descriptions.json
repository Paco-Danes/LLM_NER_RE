{
    "subject_aspect": "Indicate what aspect of the subject is being affected in the relationship. Composes with the core subject concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which the subject participates, a function/activity/role held by the subject, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the subject.",
    "object_aspect": "As the subject_aspect qualifier, but for the object.",
    "subject_context": "Restricts the setting/context/location where the core subject concept (or qualified subject concept) resides or occurs.",
    "object_context": "As the subject_context qualifier, but for the object.",
    "subject_derivative": "A qualifier that composes with a core subject concept to describe something that is derived from the core concept. For example, the qualifier 'metabolite' combines with a 'Chemical X' core concept to express the composed concept 'a metabolite of Chemical X'.",
    "object_derivative": "As the subject_derivative qualifier, but for the object.",
    "subject_direction": "Composes with the core subject concept (+ aspect if provided) to describe a change in its direction or degree. Possible values include 'increased', 'decreased', 'upregulated', or 'downregulated'.",
    "object_direction": "As the subject_direction qualifier, but for the object.",
    "subject_form_or_variant": "Composes with a core subject concept to define a specific type, variant, or alternative version of this concept. For example, the qualifier 'mutation' combines with the core concept 'Gene X' to express the composed concept 'a mutation of Gene X'.",
    "object_form_or_variant": "As the subject_form_or_variant qualifier, but for the object.",
    "subject_part": "Defines a specific part/component of the core subject concept, e.g. 'ESR1 transcript' subject_part: 'polyA tail'",
    "object_part": "As the subject_part qualifier, but for the object.",
    "anatomical_context": "A statement qualifier that describes the anatomical context (e.g., tissue, cell type, cellular component) in which the relationship occurs. For example, the context qualifier 'cerebral cortex' combines with a core concept of 'neuron' to express the composed concept 'neuron in the cerebral cortex'.",
    "stage_qualifier": "A statement qualifier that describes the developmental or temporal life stage in which the relationship occurs.",
    "causal_mechanism": "A statement qualifier representing a type of molecular control mechanism through which an effect of a chemical on a gene or gene product is mediated",
    "species_context": "A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which the relationship took place.",
    "disease_context": "A statement qualifier representing a disease or condition in which the relationship took place.",
    "response_context": "A biological response either 'therapeutic_response' (positive) or 'negative'",
    "response_target_context": "A biological response target e.g a patient, a cohort, a model system, a cell line, a sample of biological material",
    "sex_qualifier": "A qualifier used in a phenotypic relationships to state whether the relation is specific to a particular sex."
